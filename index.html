    <p1>  <br> From hearing different rumours about our current problem with the COVID-19, to believing the word "WAR" only is about guns and massive deaths and destructions. But let me tell you something, there's more than just guns,
         there's is invisibles guns that you can
        you can't see but, can be the most deadly weapon and contagious.

          There's different opinions on whether today humanity keeps using this mode of "WAR" using biological-weapons.<br><br>
