    <h1><b>History</b></h1>
    <p1><br>Biological war has existed for couple of decades already.
    One of the first case reported as a biological warfare was in 1710-1763 when
    british troops passed infected blankets to the Indians, causing the smallpox
    virus to spread among them. This was just the beginning of a new era. 
    More diseases came to life after that such as Anthrax, Plagues, Cholera and Tularemia.<br><br></p1>
    <h2>Biological weapon in World Wars</h2>
    <p2>During World War I, Germany had a secret program to use biological agents in their favor.
        The program consisted of infecting horses and cattles owned by Allied armies to infect people.
        It worked so well for Germany because the agents infiltrated the USA and infected the animals
        prior to their shipment to support the Allied forces.<br><br>
        This German program was sucessful that it caused panic to the others countries
        most of them in war decided to sign the 1925 Geneva Protocol in which consisted of banning the use
        of biological and chemical weapons in war. But a country, 
        Japan, one of the signatory parties to the protocol, engaged in a massive and clandestine research,
        development, production, and testing program in biological warfare, and it violated
        the treaty’s ban when it used biological weapons against Allied forces in China between 1937 and 1945.
        The Japanese not only used biological weapons in China, but they also experimented on and killed more
        than 3,000 human subjects (including Allied prisoners of war) in tests of biological warfare agents and
        various biological weapons delivery mechanisms.<br><br></p2>

    <p3>As of now, there is no documented evidence of any other use of biological weapons in World War II, both sides had
         active research and development (R&D) programs. The Japanese use of biological warfare agents against 
         the Chinese led to an American decision to undertake biological warfare research in order to understand 
         better how to defend against the threat and provide, if necessary, a retaliatory capability.</p3>
    <h3>Biological weapon in present</h3>
    <p4>Despite the deadly potential of biological weapons,
         their actual use remains rare and (mostly) small scale. Over the last several decades, most states have 
         given up their programs. Today, no country is openly pursuing biological weapons.</p4>
    <p5>If there's any thinking of future use of this weapons, researchers are studying the use 
        of new gene-editing techniques to fix deadly genetic mutations, create disease-resistant
        crops, and treat cancer.</p5>
    <h4><b>Future</b></h4>
    <p6>for a bioweapon attack to turn into a pandemic like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, three initial 
        conditions must be met: first, the microorganism or toxin must not have an effective remedy
         available; second, it must be easily transmittable; and third, it must be fatal for some victims.
        Whereas a number of natural-born microbes satisfied these conditions in the past, it is possible for a 
        genetically engineered bioweapon to have the same strategic impact in the future. The USA has really good
        defence but, If the United States is unable to deter or disrupt a bioweapons attack, it should be prepared
        to execute a strong defense against it. First and foremost, the military ought to maintain the health of its
        servicemembers through a COVID-19-inspired operational plan for screening and quarantine. This plan would
        facilitate prompt and sustained emergency responses and combat operations, including key missions like strategic
        nuclear deterrent patrols. Domestically, the military will need to assist in civil support, law enforcement,
        border patrol, and the defense of critical infrastructure. Internationally, the Defense Department will serve as a logistics powerhouse.</p6>
