    <h1><b>History</b></h1>
    <p1><br>Biological war has existed for couple of decades already.
    One of the first case reported as a biological warfare was in 1710-1763 when
    british troops passed infected blankets to the Indians, causing the smallpox
    virus to spread among them.<br><br></p1>
    <h2>Biological weapon in World Wars</h2>
    <p2><br>During World War I, Germany had a secret program to use biological agents in their favor.
        The program consisted of infecting horses and cattles owned by Allied armies to infect people.
        It worked so well for Germany because the agents infiltrated the USA and infected the animals
        prior to their shipment to support the Allied forces.<br><br>
        This German program was sucessful that it caused panic to the others countries
        most of them in war decided to sign the 1925 Geneva Protocol in which consisted of banning the use
        of biological and chemical weapons in war. But a country, 
        Japan, one of the signatory parties to the protocol, engaged in a massive and clandestine research,
        development, production, and testing program in biological warfare, and it violated
        the treatyâ€™s ban when it used biological weapons against Allied forces in China between 1937 and 1945.
        The Japanese not only used biological weapons in China, but they also experimented on and killed more
        than 3,000 human subjects (including Allied prisoners of war) in tests of biological warfare agents and
        various biological weapons delivery mechanisms.<br><br></p2>

    <p3>As of now, there is no documented evidence of any other use of biological weapons in World War II, both sides had
         active research and development (R&D) programs. The Japanese use of biological warfare agents against 
         the Chinese led to an American decision to undertake biological warfare research in order to understand 
         better how to defend against the threat and provide, if necessary, a retaliatory capability.</p3>
