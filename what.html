    <h1><b>Biological Warfare, what is it?</b></h1>
    <p1><br>The definition of biological warfare is basically the use of biological virus, bacterias and toxins in order to create chaos.
        This type of of of viruses and bacterias can be genetically modified in order to make it more fatal.
        As of now, modern days, there's no more "cases" of this being used.

        that many reasons, different people around the world that specializes in biology would gather enough research in order to identify the source.
        After the source it's identified, the next step would be how to deal with it. In many cases, the public health officials would
        need to track how many people has been infected, deaths, area with the most cases and quarantine
