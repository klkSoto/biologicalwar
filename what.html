    <h1><b>Biological Warfare, what is it?</b></h1>
    <p1>The definition of biological warfare is basically the use of biological virus, bacterias and toxins in order to create chaos.
        This type of of of viruses and bacterias can be genetically modified in order to make it more fatal.
        As of now, modern days, there's no more "cases" of this being used. 
    <br />
    </p1>
    <h2><b>How it's used?</b></h2>

    <p2><span style=""> Bio weapons can be strategically used in differents points as said in <a href="https://www.un.org/disarmament/biological-weapons/about/what-are-biological-weapons/">un.org article,</a> <i>"
        In addition to strategic or tactical military applications, biological weapons can be used for
       political assassinations, the infection of livestock or agricultural produce to cause food shortages and economic loss, the creation of environmental catastrophes, and the introduction of widespread illness, fear and mistrust among the public. "</i>
    <br />
    </p2>
    <p3><br>There's many different ways on how bio weapons can be delivered.. Many of its methods were
        bombs, missiles, grenades and rockets. The way that it's been more used to delivered it's been 
        injections, sprays and contaminated food.<br>

    <h3><b>&nbsp; When a disease it's identified as a weapon?</b></h3>
    <img style="float:right" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/men-dressed-in-biological-hazard-suits-in-quarantine-picture-id172884590?k=20&m=172884590&s=612x612&w=0&h=I2fPBhcOIWqPY8niMsqBzZQq7TJ2WwTeu_M7QGMa96w=" alt="agents" width="550" height="400">


    <p4>To really identify if a disease it's intentional or just nature occurence it's very difficult, but for 
        that many reasons, different people around the world that specializes in biology would gather enough research in order to identify the source.
        After the source it's identified, the next step would be how to deal with it. In many cases, the public health officials would
        need to track how many people has been infected, deaths, area with the most cases and quarantine
        that specific area.
     </p4>
     <p6>On the left section, theres some steps to apply affected and those working in a infected area must apply in order not to only battle 
         the bio weapon, but just any disease in general.<br>
        </p6>

         <p7><br>Wearing the proper gear and equipments drastically reduces the chances of your getting infected, enabling you to focus
         on your job and not worry about accidents that might occur. Also, wearing the right gear and equipments does not exclusively
         exclude you from getting infected, it just lowers the chance of being by a lot.
         <br>
         If any person that enters the area without proper care and the rights equipments would be seriously
         affected by the disease and would have to report it. Be serious about the situation,
         if you don't care about your own healthy, care for the others that can be future
         of tomorrow.
